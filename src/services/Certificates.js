// src/services/certificates.js
//
// Handles the real "did they actually finish the course" logic:
//   - watchForCourseCompletion(uid, name): watches this user's enrollments;
//     the moment one hits progress === 100, it writes ONE certificate doc
//     (checked against enrollmentId so it's never duplicated).
//   - listenToCertificates(uid, cb): live list of certificates already earned.
//
// SECURITY NOTE: this issues the certificate from the client the instant it
// sees progress hit 100 in Firestore. That's fine for a v1, but it means
// anyone who can write to their own `enrollments` doc could set progress to
// 100 directly and mint a certificate for a course they didn't finish.
// Two ways to close that:
//   1. (minimum) Firestore rule that only allows creating a certificate doc
//      if a `lessonsCompleted == totalLessons` style check passes server-side
//      via `get()` on the enrollment doc — see the rules snippet in chat.
//   2. (recommended once certificates matter) move issuance into a Cloud
//      Function triggered on enrollment writes, so completion is verified
//      with logic the client can never touch.
